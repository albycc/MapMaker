# MapMaker

I love maps and geographies and when browsing over Pinterest over maps, I wanted to create an app, where users can create their own charts over maps. Users can paint over countries, create legends or title texts and finally export the map to an image. I used D3 to render the maps and it was a superfun project todo.

## Brushes

Users can choose colour from the brush toolmenu or select colour from legend window. Users can even pick images to to use it as background paint over countries.

## Legends

Create a legend and use it as a guide for painting your chart map. You can even style it! Or you can create texts to use it as titles.
